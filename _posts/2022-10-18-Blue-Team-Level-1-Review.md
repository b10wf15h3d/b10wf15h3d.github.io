# Intro

You may question as to why an offensive security analyst (as in a Red Team member, though I do have my moments) decided to take a Blue Team course.

"Don't judge someone until you've walked a mile in their shoes" well it's the shortest summary I could come up. To be honest I was really intrigued to what being a Blue Team member was truly about as I thought their sole purpose was to chase tails and resolve issues. Having spent 18 years doing that in IT Support I had no interesting in following that path! I figured this course would help me develop a better rapport and respect for the "opposition" teams that as a Red Teamer try to assist in securing the platforms that they're responsible for.

Anyone that works on the defensive front, I tip my hat to you! ðŸ¤  You're true unsung heroes in the IT/Cyber Security world, keep up the good work, it's a tough role.

The only thing that did annoy me and have found it on many sites that offer Dark Mode is that hyperlinks are of a colour that cannot be read! You have to highlight the text to read what you're clicking!

### Tracking Progress

As I said before I really love the UX of this course and tracking my progress is part of that. Each time I checked how much I had covered it gave me that motivation to hit that next milestone, to invest that extra half hour here and there.

## Additional Material

Once I completed the course material and the labs that were available at the time I nowhere felt confident in regard to taking the exam. I signed up to Security Blue Team's equivalent to hackthebox, Blue Team Labs.

It is recommended to do the following investigations to get an idea of what the exam will be like. The only gripe I have is that even though some of the labs are shy of being 1 year old they were not "retired" so if you become stuff there were no community write-ups to guide you through the learning process.

* Deep Blue
* Countdown
* Pretium
* Sticky Situation
* Ben
* Multi Stages

# Exam

The exam represents a 24-hour incident response where you'll use the knowledge learnt in the course to answer 20 random task-based questions that require you to complete different actions and submit evidence. You can edit the answers as many times as you like until you submit them. Oh if you don't hit submit before time is up well....free resit ðŸ˜¬

Even though you'll learn a number of tools along the way, it is advised that you have confidence in using the following:

* Splunk
* Autopsy
* Wireshark
* DeepBlueCLI
* Email Analysis

# Main Gripe

The only negative I can say to the course is that I feel like there could be more labs. As I stated previously my confidence was lacking before taking the exam. Even if you repeated the included labs it would not instil enough to click that start button.

I personally would like to see at least 1 or 2 "mini investigations" included within the course. I feel like I had no option but to sign up for a months membership to the Blue Team Labs to shore up the newly learnt skills. Even if the course included 1 or 2 of these I think it would greatly aid the learner as well as work as an advertisement for that platform.


# TL;DR

* 
* 10/10 would recommend to Blue and Red teamers
* Passed with 18/10
