# Intro

You haven't truly passed your OSCP certification until you've written even a brief blog post about it. **#ThisIsTheWay**


# My Background

I have worked in IT support roles for the past 16/17 years from 1st line support to Service Desk manager. Being a "people's person" I got pigeonholed into customer facing roles and was unable to break into more technical roles. Unfortunately I became a victim of my own success and having transitioned into contract work 10 years ago it was even harder to escape.

# Studying

I have been studying for the OSCP exam on and off for about a 18 months. The biggest break being about 4/5 months. 

> There is no fixed `timeline` to when you are ready for the exam. I see many posts asking how long you need and the only appropriate response is `how long is a piece of string?` Only you'll know when the time is right.

# The Exam

Having failed the exam back in Oct '21 I entered this one very nonchalant, what will be will be! With the addition of Active Directory I really had no idea what to expect, on one hand reading Reddit posts I knew if I had covered the OSCP pdf I would be fine however on the other hand a lengthy post with dozens of disgruntled students made me weary.

## Advice

The following tips are what I believe are important whilst taking the exam.

> Pre-schedule your `breaks` before taking the exam but remember it's fluid. If you're on a roll keep going, if you're at the point of banging your head take your break early.

> `Sleep` is important, treat the exam like a working day. Even if you get 4 hours sleep it's better than "powering" through.
{: .prompt-tip }

> Prep `meals/snacks` in advance, don't waste precious time cooking. Nothing stodgy (carb heavy), don't want to fall asleep at your workstation. 
{: .prompt-tip }

## Active Directory

If you've read the course PDF then yes you have the necessary knowledge to pass the Active Directory section. I can not go into detail because of the NDA so I'll keep this section light.

> When I state the course PDF I mean in it's entirety, not just the section on Active Directory!

The Reddit posts had me very nervous when I realised that I had the AD chain that individuals had caused some noise. After a couple of hours I moved onto the BOF exploit as to not burn out my motivation before returning. Taking that step back made me realise I was on the right path before the Reddit posts came to the forefront of my mind!

## Stand Alone Machines

I stand by my view that along with technical knowledge blah blah, you will need luck on your side in passing the exam.

You could of rooted 100 HTB machines, 50 PG machines and all the PWK labs but it doesn't mean you can root what will be presented in the exam. I am not stating they are harder or easier however if the route is something you've not come across or understand you won't be able to root! 

e.g. my brother has his OSCP and 4/5 years as a Pen Tester and now Red Teamer, sometimes I can point out a vuln before he does, not because I'm better it can be from experience of exploiting something similar!

So if luck truly isn't on your side you may end up with 3 standalones that you will not get a shell on!

**TL;DR** I got root on 2/3 machines and ran out of time. Luck is a factor in exams!

# What is Next?

I know it's a cliche but ideally I want to get into penetration testing / lean towards red teaming. After 17 odd years supporting and resolving issues I have a strong drive to "swap teams" and be on the offensive side!

# TL;DR F.A.Qs

* What is your background?

IT support from resetting passwords to organising migrations of Windows 7 to 10.

* Why did you want to gain the OSCP certification?

I wanted a experience a new challenge in my career and break out of user support roles.

* How long did you study for?

On/off for about 18 months.

* Did you experience burnout?

Who doesn't?! Don't be afraid to admit it to yourself or to others. Sometimes you need to push the chair away from your desk and step away. Maybe an hour, day, week or even a month! It is natural so address the signs early on before it gets so heavy you wave the white flag and give up for good.

* What are the key resources external to the PWK labs?
