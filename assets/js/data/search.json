To be honest I was really intrigued to what being a Blue Team member was truly about as I thought their sole purpose was to chase tails and resolve issues. Having spent 18 years doing that in IT Support I had no interest in following that path! I figured this course would help me develop a better rapport and respect for the ‚Äúopposition‚Äù teams that as a Red Teamer I try to assist in securing the platforms that they‚Äôre responsible for.Anyone that works on the defensive front, I tip my hat to you! ü§† You are true unsung heroes in the IT/Cyber Security world, keep up the good work, it‚Äôs a tough job!CourseI‚Äôm unable to show the presentation (however you can sign up for the free trial for a gander) but I got to say it felt beautifully smooth!The only thing that did annoy me and have found it on many sites that offer Dark Mode is that hyperlinks are of a colour that cannot be visibly read! You have to highlight the text to read what you‚Äôre clicking!DetailsCost: ¬£399Labs: 19Access Period: 4 MonthsEst. Study Time: 30+ hoursLink: Blue Team Level 1ContentThe content itself was very well written, I would almost say that if you do not work in an IT setting already you could start the course and not struggle with the learning process (if you‚Äôre at least IT literate). On the other hand if you have a number of years experience it does not come across condescending either, though you may skim across sections here and there.Each Domain is broken into a number of sections which are made up of associated topics. The topics are appropriately sized and do not drag on to a zzz. I‚Äôve seen to much courseware which contains word salad in an attempt to pad out their content instead of focusing on the quality of the work. At the end of each section there is a short quiz to test the absorption of the information.There are a number of extra curricular activities that are not essential material but are very beneficial. These include setting up a Pfsense firewall and writing Sigma Rules for SIEM systems.Domains CoveredThe course is broken up into six domains:Course SyllabusBelow is a link to the syllabus of the course (correct at the time of posting Oct ‚Äò22)Not going to copy/paste it all but it‚Äôs good to check out if you‚Äôre interested in the course. BTL 1 SyllabusTracking ProgressAs I said before I really loved the UX of this course and ability to track my progress is part of that. Each time I checked how much I had covered it gave me that motivation to hit that next milestone, to invest that extra half hour here and there.Favourite DomainMy favourite knowledge domain has to be Digital Forensics. I had a strong interesting in DF from a young age, even meeting investigators due my connections in the security industry however attempts to break into it was futile.Anyway this was great as I got to dissect hard drive images using tools such as Autopsy. I wished there were more labs to this but from more of a personal enjoyment than a lack of material.Additional MaterialOnce I completed the course material and the labs that were available at the time I nowhere felt confident in regards to tackling the exam. So I signed up to Security Blue Team‚Äôs equivalent to hackthebox, Blue Team Labs.It is recommended to do the following investigations to get an idea of what the exam will be like. The only gripe I have is that even though some of the labs are shy of being 1 year old they were not ‚Äúretired‚Äù so if you become stuck there were no community write-ups to guide you through the learning process. However those that were the write-ups were really well written, they included why you should do X and links to research instead of screenshots of the answers. Deep Blue Countdown Pretium Sticky Situation Ben Multi Stages Blue Team LabsExamThe exam represents a 24-hour incident response where you‚Äôll use the knowledge learnt in the course to answer 20 random task-based questions that require you to complete different actions and submit evidence. You can edit the answers as many times as you like until you submit them. Oh if you don‚Äôt hit submit before time is up well‚Ä¶.free resit üò¨Even though you‚Äôll learn a number of tools along the way, it is advised that you have confidence in using the following: Splunk Autopsy Wireshark DeepBlueCLI Email AnalysisKey InfoThe following are key details of the exam that get asked in the Discord server etc.Time: 24 hoursQuestions: 20Pass Mark: 70% ( 14/20 )Gold Challenge Mark: 90% ( 18/20 )Report: NoResults: InstantFeedback: YesCool Off Period: 10 daysResit Attempt: FreeAdditional Resit: ¬£100My ResultsTime Taken: 12 hours (with lunch, snack breaks etc)Pass Mark: 18/20 (means I get the Gold Coin ü•á)Main GripeThe only negative I can say to the course is that I feel like there could be more labs. As I stated previously my confidence was lacking before taking the exam. Even if you repeated the included labs it would not instil enough to click that start button.I personally would like to see at least 1 or 2 ‚Äúmini investigations‚Äù included within the course. I feel like I had no option but to sign up for a months membership to the Blue Team Labs to shore up the newly learnt skills. Even if the course included 1 or 2 of these I think it would greatly aid the learner as well as work as an advertisement for that platform.TL;DR Great value for money. Amazing short and concise material. 10/10 would recommend to both Blue and Red teams. Passed with 18/10. Would be tempted to do BTL 2 if not for the cost." }, { "title": "You Thought You Came Here To Hack?", "url": "/posts/You-Thought-You-Came-Here-To-Hack/", "categories": "Work, Career", "tags": "work, career, job", "date": "2022-10-13 09:00:00 +0100", "snippet": "IntroI wanted to write a quick blog post on how my first three months have gone after starting my role as a Penetration Tester!I often wonder why I do not see many people write how things are going after so many posts on HTB write-ups, OSCP cheat sheets etc and now I know first hand why! The job seems to just take over and it takes a while to settle into a routine, by then the love or willingness to write evaporates. Hopefully there‚Äôll be some useful insights or takeaways from the post though it may be a be splatter gunnish in it‚Äôs layout/content!You Thought You Came Here To Hack?I do not know how it works elsewhere but my company has a comprehensive onboarding process and as I‚Äôve come to the end of it I understand the point of the journey.You do not walk in and start dropping shells willy nilly and spinning up SQLMap on customer Web Apps (and yes I am having withdrawals from the RCE rush üò¨)Here we start to create a couple of images and build out a small AD network with at least a DC, Windows 10 workstation, linux web server and Windows file server. We do this so that we can perform the following tasks: Unauth/auth Penetration Test (mix 5x devices inc. DC) 1x Webapp Penetration Test 1x Linux Server Build Review 1x Windows 10 Client Build Review 1x iPhone Build Review 1x Firewall Build ReviewThere are many reasons behind doing this, one being that we can understand how easy it can be to mis-configure a service that can lead to the same vulnerabilities we ourselves are trying to exploit. On a personal level I feel this helps us build empathy towards our clients instead of this we beat you attitude that is so easy to slide into a Pen Testers mindset, which is one reason I took the Blue Team Level 1 course ( blog post to come in due course). We are employed to assist our clients and their internal teams, not to shame them.The main purpose behind the exercise is to cover the main services we will be providing for our clients and build the foundational knowledge behind them without going gun ho on their networks. From there it is building up the soft skills to create the accompanying reports to a high standard without the panic of hitting a deadline.Technical SkillsBuild ReviewsLove those insecure service permissions for privilege escalations? How about those unquoted service paths?If you can start off with a secure build then you limit the avenues an attacker can take and that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre here to check. Of course anything that goes on post build is out of our control üò¨Firewall/Switch Build/Rule ReviewsRemember trying to pivot to the Dev or IT Admin vlan in the OSCP labs but your reverse shell kept dropping on port 4444? Well, we‚Äôre the ones the sanity check those rules to ensure they‚Äôre no ANY ANY rules enabled! Among other security concerns such as out of date software, weak encryption keys etc.Mobile Build ReviewApologies to those who wish they could use 0000 as a pin on their iPhone üòúBut hey with facial recognition and fingerprint authentication you‚Äôll rarely have to use that non-pattern 12 digit passcode anyway.Soft SkillsReport WritingEveryone‚Äôs favourite part of the job! As my boss says ‚Äúthis is the most expensive PDF most people will ever purchase!‚ÄùWe get this impression online that it‚Äôs all about the shell‚Äôs and the I got Domain Admin mic drop but it‚Äôs not. All that it worthless unless we can document our process, compile possible mitigations and in a clear concise manner. The report is in two halves, one for management from a high level aspect with impact statements and the other for the technical teams that will be reviewing and remediating what was discovered.And yes you should be anal about formatting, punctuation and grammar! Nobody should pay ¬£¬£¬£ for a report that the author forgets to remove a &amp;lt; Insert Here &amp;gt; or a different companies name as you‚Äôve forgotten to remove it from the report template. It gives the impression that client is receiving a copy/paste report with no individual personalisation.Note TakingI can not stress this enough, find a cross platform note taking solution that works for you! Like many I started off with CherryTree for my notes while studying for my OSCP however moving forward it had it‚Äôs limitations. The main issue being that I work on a Windows laptop, do a lot of my testing on a Linux VM and during my personal time I use a Apple Mac but really struggled accessing my notes across all platforms seamlessly.I am not going to re-invent the wheel and advise the available solutions, perform a quick Google search and you‚Äôll find many articles on the matter. I‚Äôve settled on Notion for the time being as it‚Äôs a cloud solution which I can access from a web browser when I‚Äôm unable to access it via the native app!WhitespaceOur role is quite intrusive on a company, so sometimes there are points where projects may get moved. This could be due to IT resources having to focus on more immediate pressing projects or the company has a product launch and does not want a distraction from their due date.Whatever the reason may be, be prepared for whitespace! Now use that time wisely, we all know after a day of work it can be hard to focus on self development. This is where whitespace comes into its own. Update your notes, write up a new process, spend a day learning a new offensive tool. Whatever you do, do not waste that time!I used last week to brush up on my Blue Team skills and take the Blue Team Level 1 exam from Security Blue. It was nice to start the exam as I would a working day instead of trying to take it on a Saturday thinking ah I need a lay maybe I‚Äôll push the exam until next week üòÇTL;DR Don‚Äôt expect to be catching shells any time soon. There is more paper work than you expect. Use non-project time for self development.

However I have to say the duo that I worked with have got to be the best I‚Äôve come across!The recruiter was working with a number of clients looking for Junior Penetration Testers whom were in process of taking their OSCP cert or had recently passed the exam. This was great for me having just passed and had no real world experience yet (17+ years in IT helped though!)With their assistance we built a profile about myself to accompany my CV so that the prospective clients would get a feel about me as a candidate. As I said with no real world experience this was great as I could get across why they should take the time and put me through their interview process to prove I could be a great addition to the team. Read the Cover Letter section at the bottom to boost your application as not all recruiters are this involved.Sending my profile to their clients one took a keen interest and wanted to put me through their interview process.The Interview ProcessThis was a two staged interview, a practical and a remote interview.Practical StageThe practical was to perform a penetration test with an allocated 3 hour time limit and then 90 minutes to write a report on my findings.As with the OSCP this was an open book practical (no unknown person watching you pick your nose!)If you‚Äôve recently passed your OSCP, work on HTB or OffSec PG then you should have no issues with this stage of the interview! Keep calm, take notes, take screenshots as you go along, take short break if necessary etc)One box was geared more towards infrastructure exploits (FTP,SMB,SMTP,etc), the second was hosting a web app and the third well numbnuts here tested my own VM provided to me! Thankfully I think the fact I provided my process of the testing they let it slide but was a ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è moment when they explained in the interview what I‚Äôd done. Read the penetration scenario/instructions twice!Video InterviewVideo/in-person interviews are all the same!They‚Äôre designed to get to know you as a person, what your previous job history is, how would you deal with situation X and Y, what sort of career progression do you perhaps see, find out more about the company etc etc.Did I Get The Job?YES! üòÑI am officially going to be a Junior Penetration Tester!The last couple years of hard work and perseverance has paid off! I was very lucky to get a job offer on my first attempt. DO NOT get disheartened if you‚Äôve had a number of interviews to no fruition. Ask for feedback and work with the advice.Job Hunting AdviceWhere to Apply?I was passed on details of a recruiter via a friend of mine whom had seen a post on the Offensive Security Discord server under the #Career channel.A number of IT Sec servers have #Career channels that mostly cover the US but there are some posts that are EU based. I suggest joining a few and check them out every couple of days as often these jobs are not advertised elsewhere.Below are my suggestions of where to search for roles, increasingly people are shying away from job websites like JobServe and heading to Linkedin / community platforms. Linkedin Reddit (checkout IT Sec related subreddits) Discord (OffSec, HTB, Blackhills, etc etc) Company Websites (find the career@ address, apply speculatively)Cover LetterIf you‚Äôre like me and have no experience in IT Security or under going a career change then I cannot stress enough to create a Cover Letter to accompany your CV.A Cover Letter is a great way to get across details that do not have a place on your CV. Answer such questions as below (don‚Äôt put the questions in the cover!) Keep it precise and to the point, essay paragraphs will bore the reader. Why or how you originally got interested in Cyber Security? What draws you to the particular role you‚Äôre applying for? What do you do in your spare time to pursue a career in Cyber Security? What route do you see your career going? What soft skills from previous roles are transferrable?

Being a ‚Äúpeople‚Äôs person‚Äù I got pigeonholed into customer facing roles and was unable to break into more technical roles. Unfortunately I became a victim of my own success and having transitioned into contract work 10 years ago it was even harder to escape.StudyingI have been studying for the OSCP exam on and off for about a 18 months. The biggest break being about 4/5 months. There is no fixed timeline to when you are ready for the exam. I see many posts asking how long you need and the only appropriate response is how long is a piece of string? Only you‚Äôll know when the time is right.PWK LabsThe PWK labs were essential to my initial learning. I know there is a consensus out there that they are ‚Äúeasy‚Äù and pointless in undertaking but I passed the AD section of the exam due to me returning to the labs a month beforehand. Re-hashing a certain attack vector is the only reason I was able to get a foothold on the AD chain.I completed 58/75 machines in the labs and unlocked all the VLANs.TJ NullIf you‚Äôve never heard of TJ Null go search for him now!TJ Null has compiled a list of OSCP like machines external to the PWK labs covering HackTheBox, OffSec‚Äôs Proving ground and Vulnhub TJ Nulls OSCP ListBurnoutWho doesn‚Äôt experience burnout?! Don‚Äôt be afraid to admit it to yourself or to others. Sometimes you need to push the chair away from your desk and step away. Maybe for an hour, day, week or even a month! It is best to address the signs early on before it gets so intense you wave the white flag and give up for good.It‚Äôs important to surround yourself with those who support what you‚Äôre trying to achieve. Taking this path awakened me to those who really support me and those who are just fair weathered friends. Treasure the people that relish in the success in others.The ExamHaving failed the exam back in Oct ‚Äò21 I entered this one very nonchalant, what will be will be! With the addition of Active Directory I really had no idea what to expect, on one hand reading Reddit posts I knew if I had covered the OSCP pdf I would be fine however on the other hand a lengthy post with dozens of disgruntled students made me weary.Oh btw I passed with 80/100 points!AdviceThe following tips are what I believe are important whilst taking the exam. Pre-schedule your breaks before taking the exam but remember it‚Äôs fluid. If you‚Äôre on a roll keep going, if you‚Äôre at the point of banging your head take your break early. Sleep is important, treat the exam like a working day. Even if you get 4 hours sleep it‚Äôs better than ‚Äúpowering‚Äù through. Prep meals/snacks in advance, don‚Äôt waste precious time cooking. Nothing stodgy (carb heavy), don‚Äôt want to fall asleep at your workstation.Active DirectoryIf you‚Äôve read the course PDF then yes you have the necessary knowledge to pass the Active Directory section. I can not go into detail because of the NDA so I‚Äôll keep this section light. When I state the course PDF I mean in it‚Äôs entirety, not just the section on Active Directory!The Reddit posts had me very nervous when I realised that I had the AD chain that individuals had caused some noise. After a couple of hours I moved onto the BOF exploit as to not burn out my motivation before returning. Taking that step back made me realise I was on the right path before the Reddit posts came to the forefront of my mind!Stand Alone MachinesI stand by my view that along with technical knowledge blah blah, you will need luck on your side in passing the exam.You could of rooted 100 HTB machines, 50 PG machines and all the PWK labs but it doesn‚Äôt mean you can root what will be presented in the exam. I am not stating they are harder or easier however if the route is something you‚Äôve not come across or understand you won‚Äôt be able to root!e.g. my brother has his OSCP and 4/5 years as a Pen Tester and now Red Teamer, sometimes I can point out a vuln before he does, not because I‚Äôm better but from experience of exploiting something similar!So if luck truly isn‚Äôt on your side you may end up with 3 standalones that you will not get a shell on!TL;DR I got root on 2/3 machines before running out of time.

For those who hold the OSCP there is a certification equivalency recognition programme that allows you to take the CPSA and convert it to the CRT.
